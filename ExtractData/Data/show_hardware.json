With this adjustment, current configuration on bus \nmb0_mb1 has a total of 800 bandwidth points. \nThis configuration has oversubscripted the PCI bus and is not a \nsupported configuration. \n\nPCI bus mb2 (Slots 2, 4, 6) has a capacity of 600 bandwidth points.\nCurrent configuration on bus mb2 has a total of 440 bandwidth points \nThis configuration is within the PCI bus capacity and is supported. \n\nPlease refer to the following document \"Cisco 7200 Series Port Adaptor\nHardware Configuration Guidelines\" on Cisco.com <http://www.cisco.com>\nfor c7200 bandwidth points oversubscription and usage guidelines.\n\nWARNING: PCI bus mb0_mb1 Exceeds 600 bandwidth points\n\n4 Ethernet interfaces\n3 FastEthernet interfaces\n2 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces\n509K bytes of NVRAM.\n\n8192K bytes of Flash internal SIMM (Sector size 256K).\nConfiguration register is 0x2102\n"}]
